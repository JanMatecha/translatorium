I am a native speaker of both Polish and Czech; life in Teschen region (approx. 20 years) enabled me to use daily Czech and Polish in personal contact or contact with authorities. Attendance of the Polish schools allowed me to improve written and literary language, to maintain cultural traditions of both nations, participate in various cultural events (film festival &quot;At the border&quot; &ndash; festival Czech, Slovak and Polish films, Czech-Polish-Slovak theaters). The one-semester study visit in Sweden allowed me to improve my fluency and written language; while studying, we had to study weekly an average of 500 pages of English text which we subsequently discussed and analyzed.</p>

    <h3> Quality guarantee: </h3>
