  <h3> About me </h3>

 <p>I am a native speaker of Slovak, Polish and Czech language. Mother Slovak, father Pole living in Silesia. I attended Polish elementary school and Polish grammar school in Cesk&yacute; Te&scaron;&iacute;n. I have also completed a one-year study of English and graduated from university &ndash; field of humanities: Political Science - International Relations. I also studied abroad in Falun, Sweden, at Dalarna University. The semester study program was conducted entirely in English, lead by American lecturer. In spring 2011, I also attended a six-month specialized legal English course. My multilingual origin allows me to think in that language, and to flexibly switch from one language to another. In case of English, I have valuable experience from studying in English at university, where in addition to reading and orientation in English text, seminar work with excellent English were required.</p>
       <h3> Top reasons to choose me</h3>
    <ul>
     <li> native speaker of 3 languages (Czech-Polish-Slovak) = ability to fluently switch from one language to another </li>
     <li> using CAT tools at work (SDL Trados 2011, 2014, MemSource) &ndash; guarantee of consistent terminology also in case of repeated translations</li>
     <li> excellent overview in the field of translations </li>
     <li> reliability and accuracy </li>
    </ul>
    
     
    <h3> What benefits can I offer?</h3>
        <p>My advantage over the competition is complete thoroughness and reliability, I work with professional terminology and search the most accurate terms &ndash; I always look up as much information as possible about the issue in the target language of the translation. I also offer the possibility of correction with the help of scientific literature supplied by client or consultation with an expert in the field. I always try to become oriented in the available literature as a way of ensuring the most accurate terminology is captured. For technical translations, I cooperate with an expert at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague (CTU); for translations of legal texts, I draw from the experience from legal English course organized by language agency Orange Tree. I am capable of ensuring larger translations (over 30 SP), I can provide a team of translators and see to it that consistent terminology was applied.</p>
